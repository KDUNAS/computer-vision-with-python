    "- Optical character recognition (OCR): reading handwritten postal codes on letters (Figure 1.4a) and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR);\n",
    "- Machine inspection: rapid parts inspection for quality assurance using stereo vision with specialized illumination to measure tolerances on aircraft wings or auto body parts (Figure 1.4b) or looking for defects in steel castings using X-ray vision;\n",
    "- Retail: object recognition for automated checkout lanes (Figure 1.4c);\n",
    "- 3D model building (photogrammetry): fully automated construction of 3D models from aerial photographs used in systems such as Bing Maps;\n",
    "- Medical imaging: registering pre-operative and intra-operative imagery (Figure 1.4d) or performing long-term studies of people’s brain morphology as they age;\n",
    "- Automotive safety: detecting unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians on the street, under conditions where active vision techniques such as radar or lidar do not work well (Figure 1.4e; see also Miller, Campbell, Huttenlocher et al. (2008); Montemerlo, Becker, Bhat et al. (2008); Urmson, Anhalt, Bagnell et al. (2008) for examples of fully automated driving);\n",
    "- Match move: merging computer-generated imagery (CGI) with live action footage by tracking feature points in the source video to estimate the 3D camera motion and shape of the environment. Such techniques are widely used in Hollywood (e.g., in movies such as Jurassic Park) (Roble 1999; Roble and Zafar 2009); they also require the use of precise matting to insert new elements between foreground and background elements (Chuang, Agarwala, Curless et al. 2002).\n",
